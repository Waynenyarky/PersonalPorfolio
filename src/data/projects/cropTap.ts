  description: `Crop-Tap is a simple and self-contained eCommerce platform that connects local farmers with nearby buyers. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs entirely in the browser with localStorage for data persistence — no server required.

    Farmers can easily manage their products and track orders, while buyers can browse fresh produce, add items to their cart, and make payments via Stripe (test/demo environment).

    Designed with a responsive interface, Crop-Tap makes local farm-to-table trading easy, accessible, and sustainable. 🌿`,
  mission: `At Crop-Tap, our mission is to empower local farmers and communities by providing a simple, accessible digital marketplace that promotes sustainability, transparency, and local growth.

    We believe technology should bring people closer to their food sources, not complicate them. By creating a platform that's easy to use and doesn't rely on external servers, we make it possible for any farmer, anywhere, to take their business online — connecting directly with local buyers, reducing waste, and strengthening community ties.

    Our goal is to make farm-to-table commerce effortless, eco-friendly, and fair — one tap at a time. 🌱`,
